## Summary

A REST API in PHP for managing events and bookings. Applied good programming practices, SOLID/DRY principles and following hexagonal architecture.

The development process is based on Test Driven Development (TDD), starting with the API tests, which define the expected behavior of the API. Then, the API is developed to meet the expectations, mocking everything until implementation is complete.

## Requirements

- `Docker` and `Docker Compose` installed on your machine

## Installation

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

Now, on browser, you can access the REST API at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Unit Testing

```sh
docker exec -it event-booking-api ./bin/phpunit
```

## Acceptance Testing

```sh
docker exec -it event-booking-api ./bin/phpunit --group=acceptance
```
